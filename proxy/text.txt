write your own in a container

it takes an input, which is the paragraph and keyWord for example, makes a call to
relevant endpoint, and sends to the front end service.

Highly configurable - any changes are easily incorporated by proxy server. e.g
if you want to add a new service or function, the proxy server can adapt easily.

1. send a request from frontend to proxy with a variable to denote the service
2. act on that variable in the proxy to send a new request to the relevant service
3. receive the result in the proxy and echo it back to the frontend
